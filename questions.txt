1.  stdint.h is a header file containing constant type definitions.
2.  Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program puts a limit on how big your int will be to minimize space unnecessarily allocated.
3.  DWORD is 4 bytes, a BYTE is 1 byte, LONG is 4 bytes, WORD is 2 bytes
4.  BMPs start with the two bytes. 0x42 0x4D
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole BMP. biSize is the size of the bitmapinfoheader, a constant 40 bytes.
6.  If biHeight is negative the bitmap is top down with the origin in the top left.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If there is an error opening the file in read or write mode.
9.  We only have one element we are dealing with.
10. 1.
11. sets the stream to a position given the offset.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the stream.
